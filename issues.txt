Currently working on:
=====================
Testing to make sure tiles are merging and scoring correctly -
    I've seem some issues, particularly 0s work at first and then
    they quit combining or the tile is getting locked in place
    (as if it's not there but it is, getting orphaned perhaps).


To dos:
=======
Add a start new game button.

=============
Enhancements:
=============
Save score and record stats to file or cookie/local storage.

Analytics: Log all movements, tiles created or modified, final scores, total moves. 

Perhaps double the X considering the theme of the game.

=====
Bugs:
=====
I've noticed that sometimes "0" tiles don't merge correctly. I saw
that the tile doesn't get deleted and remains in place so that other
tiles slide on top of it.
Reproduction:
    Haven't figured that out yet.
