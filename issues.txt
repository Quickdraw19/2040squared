Currently working on:
=====================
Testing to make sure tiles are merging and scoring correctly -
    I'm seeing that 0 tiles don't get removed (eventually say it with Neg tiles also) - the graphic representation.
    It looks like the grid array doesn't think it's there because it's being
    recognized as a empty tile. I can change the display of the phantom tile and
    see that a new tile is behind it. Logging is below.

    Update: It looks like sometimes when 0s are merged, one of them stays when they both should be removed. Yet the remaining tile stays active. I wonder if that one is eventually getting lost track of.


To dos:
=======
Add a start new game button.

=============
Enhancements:
=============
Save score and record stats to file or cookie/local storage.

Analytics: Log all movements, tiles created or modified, final scores, total moves. 

Perhaps double the X considering the theme of the game.

=====
Bugs:
=====
I've noticed that sometimes "0" tiles don't merge correctly. I saw
that the tile doesn't get deleted and remains in place so that other
tiles slide on top of it.
Reproduction:
    Haven't figured that out yet.
