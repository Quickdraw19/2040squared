Currently working on:
=====================
   Testing to make sure tiles are merging and scoring correctly - I'm seeing that 0 tiles don't 
   get removed (eventually say it with Neg tiles also) - the graphic representation.

   Update: It looks like the grid array doesn't think it's there because it's being recognized as an 
   empty tile. I can change the display of the phantom tile and see that a new tile is behind 
   it. Logging is below.

      Update 2: It looks like it happens when 3 or more special tiles are merged. It still shows
      on the grid, but it's not in the internal grid.

         Update 3: It's definatley when at least 3 are being merged. Need to check on the order
         of merging precedence. It looks like the new random tile is always be inserted where
         the special tile disappered when the problem happens.
   Next:
      Need to figure out what is going on when the 3 tiles merge.


To dos:
=======
Add a start new game button.

=============
Enhancements:
=============
Save score and record stats to file or cookie/local storage.

Analytics: Log all movements, tiles created or modified, final scores, total moves. 

Perhaps double the X considering the theme of the game.

=====
Bugs:
=====
I've noticed that sometimes "0" tiles don't merge correctly. I saw
that the tile doesn't get deleted and remains in place so that other
tiles slide on top of it.
Reproduction:
    Haven't figured that out yet.
