Currently working on:
=====================
Bugs:
After refactoring, the slide transition isn't working anymore.




   Testing to make sure tiles are merging and scoring correctly - I'm seeing that 0 tiles don't 
   get removed (eventually say it with Neg tiles also) - the graphic representation.

   Update: It looks like the grid array doesn't think it's there because it's being recognized as an 
   empty tile. I can change the display of the phantom tile and see that a new tile is behind 
   it. Logging is below.

      Update 2: It looks like it happens when 3 or more special tiles are merged. It still shows
      on the grid, but it's not in the internal grid.

         Update 3: It's definatley when at least 3 are being merged. Need to check on the order
         of merging precedence. It looks like the new random tile is always be inserted where
         the special tile disappered when the problem happens.
   Next:
      Need to figure out what is going on when the 3 tiles merge.
Sequence:
R-B-B -> (Red pushed toward blues) R and 1 B gets removed. The other B gets ghosted. (x3 repeated)
B-B-R -> (Blues pushed into the red) Same as R-B-B. Indicating it doesn't matter what direction they are being pushed. (x3)
B-R-R -> (Blue pushed into reds) Same as above except the 2nd red gets ghosted. x1

E-B-R-B -> (Free space on left, pushing away from free space) Nothing ghosted but blue and right was removed but not 
         the red. (x1)
R-E-B-R -> Worked correctly? The end blue and red were removed. The other red remaning in the 3rd postition. x1
R-E-B-B <- Slide all the way to the 1st postion. Red and a blue canceled out. Other blue got ghosted in 1st position. x1

R-R-B-R -> All disappeared (x1 repeated)
R-R-R-B <- (Blue pushed into reds) Blue and a red where removed. Red ghosted on first spot and a red remaining in 
         second spot (x1)
To dos:
=======
Add a start new game button.

=============
Enhancements:
=============
Save score and record stats to file or cookie/local storage.

Analytics: Log all movements, tiles created or modified, final scores, total moves. 

Perhaps double the X considering the theme of the game.

Bugs:
=====
I've noticed that sometimes "0" tiles don't merge correctly. I saw
that the tile doesn't get deleted and remains in place so that other
tiles slide on top of it.
Reproduction:
    Haven't figured that out yet.
